# SumOfDigits

. Write a method with the name sumDigits that has one int parameter called number.

- If parameter is >= 10 then the method should process the number and return sum of
all digits, otherwise return -1 to indicate an invalid value.

- The numbers from 0-9 have 1 digit so 't want to process them, also we don't
want to process negative numbers, 5 urn -1 for negative numbers.

- For example calling the method sumD 25) should return 8 since 1 + 2 + S = 8.
